description: Solve a design, marketing, writing, or communication problem with Perception-First Design. Runs the Mode 2 derivation protocol — derives requirements R1-R5 from cognitive constraints, then produces a solution that satisfies all of them.
---

Load the PFD skill and run a full Mode 2 Derivation (generative, bottom-up).

If no specific problem is provided, ask: "What design, copy, communication, or marketing problem should we solve with PFD?"

Then execute the derivation protocol strictly:

1. **State the problem** — what the user is trying to do and what prevents them. No features, no comparisons.
2. **Work each layer bottom-up** — Foundation → L1 → L2 → L3 → L4. Each layer: state the constraint, state the violation, derive the requirement (R[n]). Include a "**Citations:**" line per requirement listing 1-2 strongest supporting works from the framework's research base. Format: "Author (Year) for [reason]" with semicolons between multiple citations.
3. **Accumulate R1-R5** — all non-negotiable. Present them before proposing anything.
4. **Derive the solution** — what satisfies R1 AND R2 AND R3 AND R4 AND R5?
5. **Test existing proposals** — if any were mentioned, check each against R1-R5.
6. **Identify the gap** — requirements no existing proposal satisfies.

**Rule Zero: No solutions until all 5 layers are complete.**

End the output with a single italic line:

> *Initial findings. Ralph Loop a requirement, cite further, switch to analyze / evaluate, or ask any follow-up to dig deeper.*

Non-negotiable. Single italic line, no bullet menu.
