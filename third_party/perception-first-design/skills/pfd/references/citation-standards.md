## Rules When Applying PFD

1. **Cite the paper, not the concept.** Say "Lindgaard et al., 2006" not "research shows."
2. **State what the paper actually found.** Lindgaard found 50ms VISUAL APPEAL judgments — not 50ms comprehensive evaluation. Don't overextend.
3. **Flag practitioner synthesis vs science.** The 5-layer dependency stack is Stefan's practitioner synthesis organizing published findings — it has not been tested as a unified model. Individual layers are grounded in published research. The architecture is applied theory.
4. **Mark unverified claims.** If citing something uncertain, say: "[needs verification]" or "I recall this but can't confirm the exact paper." Never present uncertain citations as confident.
5. **Distinguish claim types:**
   - **Hard science:** Cowan 2001, Lindgaard 2006, Reber & Schwarz 1999 → verified experiments
   - **Theoretical frameworks:** Clark 2013, Friston 2010 → influential models, not settled law
   - **Practitioner observations:** Stefan's case studies, accumulated learnings → documented experience, not controlled experiments
   - **Applied predictions:** consequences derivable from framework mechanisms when no direct citation supports the specific finding → tag transparently with closest adjacent citation per `commands/analyze.md`. Example: search-engine self-tax from removing the URL bar lives at Decision Architecture × Perception Bias but no direct study quantifies it
   - **Design heuristics:** "2 fonts max," "3-4 colors" → professional rules of thumb, not science

## Flagged Citations (Verify Before Public Use)

- **Maier et al. (2022)** — Nudge meta-analysis. Framework says "near-zero after bias correction." Needs manual verification of exact paper and characterization.
- **Hu (2025)** — d=0.004 second-order correction on nudges. Cannot verify from AI training data. Very specific claim — likely real but unconfirmed.
- **Dechêne et al. (2010)** — Framework says "confirmed fluency → truth in 51-study meta-analysis." More precisely: confirmed repetition → truth effect; fluency is the proposed mediating mechanism.

## Verified Citation Count (as of v3.6)

- 55/55 framework citations verified (correct authors, years, findings)
- 0 hallucinated citations detected
- 2 flagged for manual verification (both recent: 2022, 2025)
- 5 additional references from brainstorm (Siegel & White 1975, Bertin 1967, Lynch 1960, Cleveland & McGill 1984, Shneiderman 1996) — all verified

### v3.3 Additions (2026-02-26)

**2 citations added:**
- Bujack, Teti, Miller, Turton & Rogers (2022) — Non-Riemannian perceptual color space, diminishing returns effect (*PNAS*). Verified: paper exists, findings accurately characterized. **Cite as theoretical framework, not settled law.** Brainard commentary flags aggregation concern. Online data collection is methodologically weak for color science. The design implication (near-miss color deviations are disproportionately costly) holds regardless of geometric debate.
- Brainard, D. (2022) — "Proximity Matters," PNAS commentary. Verified: published as formal commentary on Bujack et al. Raises: (1) achromatic geodesic assumed not tested, (2) aggregate non-Riemannian behavior could be artifact of averaging individually Riemannian observers, (3) online methods lack calibration rigor.

**Note on Feb 2026 "completed" headlines:** Bujack et al. (2025, *Computer Graphics Forum*) formalized the neutral axis definition in non-Riemannian color space. Science journalism framed this as "Schrödinger's color theory completed after 100 years." The actual scope: one missing mathematical component was defined. Many open problems remain (individual observer modeling, adaptation, context effects, temporal dynamics). **Do not cite the "completed" framing.** Cite the non-additivity finding (2022 PNAS) with appropriate hedging.

### v3.2 Audit Corrections (2026-02-25)

**Mischaracterizations fixed:**
- **Tractinsky et al. 2006:** Was characterized as "critique" of 50ms findings. Actually replicated and confirmed Lindgaard. Corrected in body text and Appendix A.
- **Miller 1956 body text:** Was "proposed 7±2 as a working memory limit." Corrected to rhetorical observation about channel capacity (table entry was already correct).
- **McGurk & MacDonald 1976:** "override" → "integrate with, producing fused percepts"
- **Zak 2015:** Hedge strengthened significantly. Intranasal oxytocin field has ~90% false positive rate (Mierop et al., 2020). Neurochemical mechanism now labeled "undemonstrated." Narrative persuasion evidence redirected to Green & Brock 2000, van Laer et al. 2014, Braddock & Dillard 2016.

**Precision improvements:**
- "Attention is off" → "effortful attention is dormant"
- "It's neurology" → "it's psychology" + boundary conditions
- "3-4 chunks" → "3-5 chunks" per Cowan 2010
- Dependency stack "block" → "significantly degrade"
- Processing fluency → truth: hedged font-specific replication variability

**5 citations added:**
- Cowan, N. (2010) — "The Magical Mystery Four," 3-5 chunks (*BBS*)
- Reinecke et al. (2013) — 17ms visual evaluation (Google Research)
- van Laer et al. (2014) — Narrative transportation meta-analysis, 132 effect sizes
- Braddock & Dillard (2016) — Narrative persuasion meta-analysis
- Mierop et al. (2020) — Intranasal oxytocin systematic review, ~90% false positive rate

### v3.5 Additions (2026-04-02)

**5 citations added** (77 → 82 total):
- **Damasio, A. (1994)** — Somatic marker hypothesis. Body generates emotional signals biasing decisions before conscious deliberation. Iowa Gambling Task demonstrates pre-conscious affect influencing choice. → Layer: L3 / pre-verbal arousal mechanism. **Cite as theoretical framework** — foundational but debate continues on mechanism specificity.
- **LeDoux, J. (1996)** — Amygdala "low road" ~12ms vs. cortical "high road" 200–300ms. Neural architecture explaining why emotional response precedes conscious evaluation. → Layer: L1 / pre-verbal arousal mechanism. **Cite as theoretical framework** — timing estimates vary by study; core asymmetry is robust.
- **Lavie, N. (1995)** — Perceptual load theory. Higher perceptual load in focal task eliminates distracter processing by exhausting attentional capacity. Lower-level demands eliminate higher-level attentional capacity. → Layer: L0 / dependency stack mechanism. Hard science — replicated across modalities.
- **Servajean, V. (2024)** — Fluency = prediction error amplitude. Fluent processing IS low prediction error — not a separate phenomenon layered on top of prediction. Unifies processing fluency with predictive processing frameworks. → Layer: L2 / predictive processing backbone. **Cite as theoretical framework** — recent, needs replication watch.
- **Joffily, M. & Coricelli, G. (2013)** — Emotional valence = rate of change of free energy. Positive affect arises from error reduction; negative affect from error increase. Each layer resolving errors produces positive affect compounding upward through the stack. → Cascade mechanism. **Cite as theoretical framework** — integrates active inference with affective science; influential but not settled law.

### v3.6 Additions (2026-04-20)

**17 citations added** (82 → ~100 total). International research integration across six traditions (DE/AT/CH, JP, CN, FR, NL/IL/Scandinavia). Each cite threaded into the framework as an active rule, not a weighted footnote. All 17 verified via DOI or journal archive in the 6-agent research pass (2026-04-19). No fabrications.

**Methodology Siblings (new H2 section before "The Framework"):**
- **Nagamachi, M. (1995).** Kansei engineering: systematic methodology mapping consumer affective response to product attributes. Hiroshima University. → Layer: Core/Sibling. Named as PFD's Japanese intellectual ancestor. **Cite as methodology sibling:** established methodology in Japanese automotive, consumer electronics, and product design.
- **Wertheimer, M. (1923).** Gestalt foundations: perception as organized wholes, not sums of parts. Berlin School. → Layer: L1/L2 anchor. PFD's L1 and L2 are applied Gestalt. **Cite as hard science:** foundational empirical treatment, replicated across a century.
- **Metzger, W. (1936 / 2006 trans.).** Comprehensive Gestalt empirical treatment (English translation 2006). → Layer: L1/L2 anchor, complements Wertheimer. **Cite as hard science.**
- **Skov, M. & Nadal, M. (2020).** Neuroaesthetics as hedonic valuation, neural substrates of aesthetic experience. Copenhagen. → Layer: L1 anchor, Sibling. **Cite as theoretical framework:** integrative review of neuroaesthetics field.
- **Leder, H., Belke, B., Oeberst, A. & Augustin, D. (2004).** 5-stage aesthetic appreciation model (perception → implicit integration → explicit classification → cognitive mastery → evaluation). Vienna. → Layer: L1 subroutine. **Cite as theoretical framework:** the most-cited model in modern empirical aesthetics; mechanism specificity still debated.

**L0 rule (unconscious working memory):**
- **Hassin, R.R., Bargh, J.A., Engell, A.D. & McCulloch, K.C. (2009).** Implicit working memory. WM capacity spent on unconscious processing, not just conscious attention. → Layer: L0. **Cite as hard science:** behavioral + dual-task replications. Reframes L0 scope: design for what the brain processes, attended or not.

**L1 rules (pre-verbal arousal polarities):**
- **Mori, M. (1970) / MacDorman & Kageki (2012 translation).** Uncanny valley: near-human-but-not-quite triggers eeriness response before conscious evaluation. → Layer: L1 negative-polarity failure mode. **Cite as theoretical framework:** originally proposed (1970); formal empirical work in humanoid robotics from 2006 onward.
- **Pessiglione, M. et al. (2007).** Subliminal incentive processing. Reward cues below conscious threshold drive motor behavior. → Layer: L1 positive-polarity success mode (also reinforces pre-verbal arousal passage in "The Framework"). **Cite as hard science:** fMRI + behavioral, replicated.

**L2 rule (subjective felt fluency):**
- **Forster, M., Leder, H. & Ansorge, U. (2013).** Subjective felt fluency drives aesthetic liking; objective fluency alone is insufficient. Vienna. → Layer: L2. **Cite as hard science:** directly tests subjective vs objective fluency dissociation. Lighthouse-vs-lived-fluency gap is where L2 actually lives.

**L3 rule (visual trust):**
- **Seckler, M., Heinz, S., Forde, S., Tuch, A.N. & Opwis, K. (2015).** Visual characteristics (color coherence, typographic quality, layout consistency) drive trust judgments directly. Basel. → Layer: L3. **Cite as hard science:** multi-study empirical program, controlled stimuli. Trust is a perceptual output, not a rational one.

**L3/Core anchor (pre-verbal arousal reinforcement):**

Unconscious performs every high-level cognitive function previously assumed to require awareness. → Layer: L3, Core. **Cite as theoretical framework:** comprehensive review consolidating evidence across decision-making, goal pursuit, cognitive control, and self-regulation. Empirical backbone for pre-verbal arousal as primary processing mode.

**L4 rules (evidence-based decision architecture):**
- **Hertwig, R. & Erev, I. (2009).** The description-experience gap in risky choice. *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*, 13(12), 517–523. Decisions from description underweight rare events; decisions from experience weight them accurately. → Layer: L4. **Cite as hard science:** robust across dozens of follow-up studies. Intervention: demonstrate via interactive previews, trials, or samples rather than describing.
- **Trope, Y. & Liberman, N. (2010).** Construal-level theory. Psychological distance (temporal, spatial, social, hypothetical) shapes concrete vs abstract linguistic processing. → Layer: L4. **Cite as theoretical framework:** widely replicated but effect sizes vary by operationalization. Intervention: match linguistic register to commitment distance of the ask.

**Cultural Calibration (cross-cutting meta-rule in Open Questions):**
