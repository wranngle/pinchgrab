# PFD-S: Spatial Interface Extension (v0.1)

Load this file when applying PFD to canvas tools, spatial interfaces, or any system where users create and navigate content layouts (Cognograph, Figma, Miro, Notion, etc.).

PFD-S extends the 5 core layers with spatial-specific constraints. Apply PFD-S principles IN ADDITION TO R1-R5, not instead of them.

## The Five PFD-S Principles

**S1: Depth-Attention Congruence** (extends L0)
Rendered information density must match the user's current attentional resolution. At spatial overview scale → landmark info only. At reading scale → full content. Mixing these creates cognitive overload without increasing comprehension.

**S2: Schema-Spatial Alignment** (extends L1)
Spatial container shapes must match the schemas of the content they hold. Cards trigger scan-mode. Documents trigger read-mode. Putting document-length content in card-sized containers activates the wrong cognitive mode — users scan when they should be reading.

**S3: Mode Signal Clarity** (extends L2)
Transitions between cognitive modes (navigation → comprehension → reflection) must be explicitly signaled. Implicit transitions cause disorientation. The signal must be legible at the moment of transition, not after.

**S4: Cognitive Mode Containers** (extends L3)
Each mode (map/navigation, document/comprehension, flow/creation) requires its own perceptual container. Containers cannot be merged, only switched. Attempting to serve multiple cognitive modes with one visual treatment satisfies none.

**S5: Spatial Trust Architecture** (extends L4)
Trust in spatial tools is built through depth access. Surface-only interaction = utility. Deep content access = cognitive partner. The decision architecture must make depth feel rewarding and recoverable, not risky.

## Key Spatial Findings (from accumulated learnings)

**Route vs Survey Knowledge** (Learning 12):
Users develop route knowledge before survey knowledge (Siegel & White, 1975). Canvas tools must support both stages:
- New users: route affordances (guided paths, breadcrumbs, landmarks)
- Experienced users: survey affordances (minimap, district overview, configurable views)

S1's "appropriate density" depends on which knowledge stage the user is in — don't assume survey knowledge in new users.

**Bertin's Visual Channels** (Learning 11):
Most canvas tools use 2-3 of Bertin's 7 visual variables (position, size, value, texture, color, orientation, shape). Run a channel audit after deriving R1-R5: which channels carry signal? Which are unused and could carry pre-attentive information?

## When to Apply PFD-S

Apply PFD-S when:
- The interface involves spatial navigation (zooming, panning, positioning)
- Users create layouts or arrange content nodes
- Multiple zoom levels reveal different amounts of content
- The user is both consumer and creator of content in the same space
- Cognitive mode switching is part of the core workflow
