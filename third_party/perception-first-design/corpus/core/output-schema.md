# PFD Evaluation Output Schema

> **For Claude Code use, this defines the expected content structure (conversational output).** The evaluation is rendered as structured Markdown following the output format in the Tier 2 prompt template. For future API/Forge deployment, this becomes the strict JSON schema for Claude's structured outputs mode (`output_config.format`), where the Pydantic classes below compile into grammar artifacts that constrain token generation during inference.

## Schema Definition (Pydantic-Style)

### Severity

```python
class Severity(str, Enum):
    critical = "critical"   # Blocks the entire layer. Layer capped at 30.
    major = "major"         # Significant perception impact. Degrades the layer score substantially.
    minor = "minor"         # Noticeable but low perception impact. Small score deduction.
```

Severity maps to perception impact, not visual prominence. A 2px border-radius inconsistency is minor (low perception cost). A missing responsive viewport is critical (blocks the entire Foundation layer). A missing CTA above the fold is major (significant L1/L4 degradation). Match severity to how much the violation degrades the user's ability to process, trust, and act.

### Status

```python
class Status(str, Enum):
    pass_ = "pass"       # Layer score >= 70. Core requirements satisfied.
    fail = "fail"        # Layer score 30-69. Significant issues present.
    critical = "critical" # Layer score < 30. Fundamental failures.
```

### Citation

```python
class Citation(BaseModel):
    study: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Study name and author from the reference material loaded in Slot [4]. "
                    "Must match a citation in the psychology reference corpus. "
                    "Example: 'Cowan 2010: The Magical Mystery Four'"
    )
    finding: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="The specific finding being cited. Not the full abstract, "
                    "but the particular result relevant to this violation. "
                    "Example: 'Working memory holds 3-5 chunks, not Miller's 7+/-2'"
    )
    relevance: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Why this finding applies to THIS specific violation on THIS site. "
                    "Not a generic restatement of the finding. "
                    "Example: 'This site's 87 interactive elements exceed the 50-element "
                    "threshold derived from Cowan's 4+/-1 chunk capacity'"
