# repo-relative so it matches the rest of the bash adapter's conventions:
# `.symphony/logs/` is on the standard Vector tail include glob.

# Override per environment by setting `SYMPHONY_LOG_FILE` (used by
# `Symphony.Application.default_sink/0`) or by overriding
# `config :symphony, :logging_sink, ...` in a release config.
