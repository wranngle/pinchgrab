# Tests that exercise the web surface (`Symphony.WebCase`) need a stable,
# long-lived endpoint and pubsub server — starting them under each test's
# process leaks ETS tables when the test process dies.
#
# We boot them ONCE here, outside the ExUnit test pool, so they live for
# the entire test run. The persistence is the key: test cleanup hooks no
# longer get to kill the endpoint. The HttpServer test still verifies
# its public surface but no longer assumes ownership of the endpoint
# lifecycle.
